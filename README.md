# Policy Gradient on a Rubik's cube

We delve into the process of modeling a Rubik's Cube and leveraging Policy Gradient (PG) techniques and Neural Network policy approximation, to analyze and potentially enhance the cube-solving algorithms.

Everything has been designed from scratch, then build through Numpy.

You can discover more about the process in the following YouTube video
