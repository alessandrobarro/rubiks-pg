# Policy Gradient on a Rubik's cube

We delve into the process of modeling a Rubik's Cube and leveraging Policy Gradient (PG) techniques, particularly within the PyTorch framework, to analyze and potentially enhance the cube-solving algorithms. The core objective is to explore the feasibility and efficiency of applying reinforcement learning strategies, specifically the Policy Gradient method, to the domain of Rubik's Cube, which is known for its complex state space and the need for strategic planning to achieve the solved state
