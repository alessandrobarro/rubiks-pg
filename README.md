# Policy Gradient on a Rubik's cube

We delve into the process of modeling a Rubik's Cube and leveraging Policy Gradient (PG) techniques and Neural Network policy approximation. This was done to analyze and potentially enhance/discover cube-solving algorithms, but mainly for fun :D.

Everything has been designed from scratch, then build through Numpy.

You can discover more about the process in the following YouTube video



Also, make sure to check the demo available on my website!
