# Policy Gradient on a Rubik's cube

We delve into the process of modeling a Rubik's Cube and leveraging Policy Gradient (PG) techniques and Neural Network policy approximation. This was done to analyze and potentially enhance/discover cube-solving algorithms, but mainly for fun :D.

Everything has been designed from scratch, then build through Numpy.

You can discover more about the process in the following YouTube video
